For this project we transform the USDA U.S Food Imports Dataset into a time series, and then use Python to implement and use Single Exponential and Double Exponential Smoothing on the time series to make predictions about the next year.

We downloaded the original dataset from https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/u-s-food-imports.

This is a work in progress.
